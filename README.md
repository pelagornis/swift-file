üìÅ **File** is a powerful and intuitive file management library for Swift. It simplifies file and folder operations, providing a consistent API across different platforms. File is designed to make working with the file system a breeze, whether you're reading, writing, creating, or deleting files and folders.

## Installation

File was deployed as Swift Package Manager. Package to install in a project. Add as a dependent item within the swift manifest.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/pelagornis/swift-file", from: "1.1.0")
    ],
    ...
)
```

Then import the File from thr location you want to use.

```swift
import File
```

## Documentation

The documentation for releases and `main` are available here:

- [`main`](https://pelagornis.github.io/swift-file/main/documentation/file)

## Using

Path Setting.

```swift
let path = Path("/Users/ji-hoonahn/Desktop/") // example
```

Easy access path.

```swift
Path.current
Path.root
Path.library
Path.temporary
Path.home
Path.documents
```

#### Writing String Data

This example demonstrates how to create a file and write a string to it.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
try file.write("Hello, File!")
```

#### Writing Binary Data

This example shows how to write binary data to a file.

```swift
import Foundation
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "binary.data")
let data = Data([0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
try file.write(data)
```

#### Appending String Data

This example demonstrates how to append a string to an existing file.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
try file.append(" This is appended content.")
```

#### Appending Binary Data

This example shows how to append binary data to an existing file.

```swift
import Foundation
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "binary.data")
let data = Data([0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07])
try file.append(data)
```

#### Reading Data

This example demonstrates how to read data from a file.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
try file.write("Hello, File!")
let readData = try file.read()
if let readString = String(data: readData, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(readString) // Output: Hello, File!
}
```

#### Opening a File (AppKit)

If `AppKit` is available, this example shows how to open a file using `AppKit`.

```swift
#if canImport(AppKit) && !targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
file.open()
#endif
```

#### Handling FileError

This example shows how to catch and handle `FileError`.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.root
let filePath = Path("/path/that/do/not/exist/example.txt")

do {
    let folder = try Folder(path: path)
    let file = try folder.createFile(at: filePath)
    try file.write("this will fail")
} catch let error as FileError {
    print("FileError: \(error.message)")
    if let underlyingError = error.error {
        print("Underlying error: \(underlyingError)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

### Folder Examples

#### Creating Subfolders and Files

This example demonstrates how to create subfolders and files within a folder.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let subfolder = try folder.createSubfolder(at: "subfolder")
let newFile = try subfolder.createFile(at: "newFile.txt")
try newFile.write("Content of the new file")
```

#### Retrieving Files and Subfolders

This example shows how to retrieve files and subfolders from a folder.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
_ = try folder.createSubfolder(at: "subfolder")
_ = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
let files = folder.files
let subfolders = folder.subfolders
print(files) // Output: Contains "example.txt"
print(subfolders) // Output: Contains "subfolder"
```

#### Moving and Copying Contents

This example shows how to move and copy the contents of a folder to another folder.

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let destinationFolder = try Folder(path: Path(path.rawValue + "destination"))
_ = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
_ = try folder.createSubfolder(at: "subfolder")
try folder.moveContents(to: destinationFolder)
let files = destinationFolder.files
let subfolders = destinationFolder.subfolders
print(files) // Output: Contains "example.txt"
print(subfolders) // Output: Contains "subfolder"

let copyFolder = try Folder(path: Path(path.rawValue + "copy"))
try destinationFolder.copy(to: copyFolder)

```

#### Emptying the Folder

This example shows how to empty a folder (delete all its contents).

```swift
import File

let path = Path.temporary
let folder = try Folder(path: path)
_ = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
_ = try folder.createSubfolder(at: "subfolder")
try folder.empty()
```

#### Deleting Content

try file.delete()
try subfolder.delete()
```

### FileSystem Examples

print(file.name) // Output: newName.txt
```

#### Moving

let folder = try Folder(path: path)
let destinationFolder = try Folder(path: Path(path.rawValue + "destination"))
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "example.txt")
try file.move(to: destinationFolder)
```

#### Copying

### New Features

#### Existence Check

Check if a file or folder exists:

```swift
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "existTest.txt")
if file.exists() {
    print("File exists!")
}
if folder.exists() {
    print("Folder exists!")
}
```

#### List All Files and Folders (Recursive)

Get all files and folders recursively:

```swift
let allFiles = folder.allFiles(recursive: true)
let allFolders = folder.allFolders(recursive: true)
```

#### Symbolic Link

Create and check symbolic links:

```swift
let target = try folder.createFile(at: "target.txt")
let linkPath = folder.store.path.rawValue + "link.txt"
let linkStore = try Store<File>(path: Path(linkPath), fileManager: .default)
try linkStore.createSymbolicLink(to: target.store.path)
if linkStore.isSymbolicLink() {
    print("This is a symbolic link!")
    print("Destination: \(linkStore.destinationOfSymbolicLink()?.rawValue ?? "")")
}
```

#### File/Folder Permissions

Get and set POSIX permissions:

```swift
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "perm.txt")
let originalPerm = file.store.getPermissions()
try file.store.setPermissions(0o600)
let newPerm = file.store.getPermissions()
print("New permissions: \(String(newPerm ?? 0, radix: 8))")
```

#### File/Folder Change Watch (macOS/iOS)

Watch for changes to a file or folder:

```swift
#if os(macOS) || os(iOS)
let file = try folder.createFile(at: "watch.txt")
let source = file.store.watch {
    print("File changed!")
}
try file.write("changed!")
// Don't forget to cancel the source when done:
if let src = source as? DispatchSourceFileSystemObject { src.cancel() }
#endif
```
